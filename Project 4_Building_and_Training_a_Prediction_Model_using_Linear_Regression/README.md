# Building and Training a Prediction Model using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to build and train a prediction model using linear regression. The notebook walks through the process of loading datasets, visualizing data, training a model, and making predictions. It also includes exercises to practice these concepts.

## Overview

The project is divided into the following tasks:

- **Load and Explore Data**: Load a dataset from a CSV file and explore its structure.
- **Visualize Data**: Create scatter plots to understand relationships between variables.
- **Build and Train a Model**: Use the `LinearRegression` class from `scikit-learn` to train a model.
- **Evaluate and Predict**: Evaluate the model's performance and make predictions using new data.

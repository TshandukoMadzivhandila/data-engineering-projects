# Metrics_for_Regression

This project demonstrates how to evaluate regression models using various metrics in Python. It uses datasets such as car MPG and diamond prices to build linear regression models and assess their performance.

## Features

- Loads datasets using pandas
- Splits data into training and testing sets
- Trains linear regression models with scikit-learn
- Evaluates models using:
  - RÂ² Score
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Visualizes data with scatter plots

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas==1.3.4
- scikit-learn==0.20.1
- numpy==1.21.6

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas==1.3.4 scikit-learn==0.20.1 numpy==1.21.6

# Data Engineering Projects Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is a collection of hands-on **data engineering projects** designed to build, demonstrate, and refine skills across the core domains of data engineering.

My goal is to use this space to continuously learn, apply, and showcase my capabilities in working with data pipelines, big data tools, cloud services, and scalable architectures as part of my **career growth in data engineering**.

## About Me

I’m an aspiring data engineer with a solid foundation in Python, SQL, and data transformation. Through this portfolio, I’m building projects that mimic real-world workflows, strengthen my engineering mindset, and demonstrate my ability to work with production-style data systems.

I’m passionate about working with data and I’m actively seeking opportunities to grow in this field.

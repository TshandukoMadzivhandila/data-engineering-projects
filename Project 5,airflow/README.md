# ETL Pipeline with Apache Airflow

This project demonstrates a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built using **Apache Airflow**. The DAG downloads a web server log file, extracts relevant fields, transforms the data by capitalizing it, and saves the final output to a file.

---

## Workflow Summary

The DAG performs the following five steps:

1. **Download**: Retrieve a log file from a public URL.

2. **Extract**: Extract selected fields from each line in the file.

3. **Transform**: Convert the extracted content to uppercase.

4. **Load**: Write the transformed data to an output file.

5. **Check**: Display the contents of the final output file in the logs.

## File Definitions

| File Name              | Description                                       |

| `web-server-access-log.txt` | Input log file downloaded from the web          |

| `extracted-data.txt`         | File containing selected fields from the input |

| `transformed.txt`            | File with transformed (uppercase) content      |

| `capitalized.txt`            | Final output file                              |

## Task Breakdown

| Task ID         | Description                                        |

| `download`      | Downloads the log file using a Python function     |

| `extract`       | Parses the file and extracts specific fields       |

| `transform`     | Converts the extracted data to uppercase           |

| `load`          | Writes the uppercase data to a new file            |

| `check`         | Prints the contents of the final file to the logs  |

## Requirements

Ensure the following Python packages are installed:

```bash

pip install apache-airflow requests pendulum
Usage
Place the script in your Airflow DAGs directory.

Replace 'Your name' and 'your email' in the default_args.

Start the Airflow scheduler and webserver:

airflow scheduler

airflow webserver

Trigger the DAG manually or wait for the scheduled run.
Notes
Output files are written to the working directory where Airflow runs.

The DAG uses local file I/O; ensure Airflow has permissions to read/write in the working directory.
